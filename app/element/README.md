# Elements
Elements are modular are parts designed to be swapped in and out of the Builder using a Configuration. 
These elements are for demonstration purposes. 
You're not locked into using any of them. 
Build your own Custom Elements and share back reusable ones back for consideration as a Core Element.

## Atomic Design
It is recommended to think of atomic design when developing custom elements. 
Consider what Atomic Design stage the output would fall into, either:
+ an atom (basic HTML elements), 
+ a molecule (simple elements functioning together), or
+ a organism (complex UI components).

Elements often reside within page templates, but are not mean to serve as standalone templates.

## WYSIWYG
Elements can be integrated with a WYSIWYG, such as TinyMCE, to empower curators.
