            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                We make software that breaks assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Ouxsoft, we specialize in making scalable cloud-based software solutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Ouxsoft Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                Ouxsoft is made of both the words “oux” and “soft.” The first word, “oux”, chosen because “Oux” is short
                for Ourococcus, which is a green genus of algae. The fundamental idea being that that small things
                coalescing over time have a big impact. The second word, “soft”, is short for the word “software”
                as that is what we make.
            </p>

            <h2>Logo Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                Each of the larger ellipses that form a circle in the logo are designed to be ourococcus. The eye-like
                structure is dual purpose, it is both the ourococcus nucleus and shaped like an eye to represent the eye
                and the evolution of perception. The eight ellipses are coalescing to form multicellular life. The
                number eight symbolizes balance, luck, and the ultimate form of achievement.
