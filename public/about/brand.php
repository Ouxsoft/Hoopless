            <p class="lead-meta">Why <b>Ouxsoft</b>?</p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Ouxsoft stems from the words “oux” and “soft.” “Oux” is short for Ourococcus. What is ourococcus you might
                ask? Well it's a green genus of algae. Why algae? Well, because we believe small things coalescing over
                time have a big impact. More traditionally, the “soft” part is short for "software” as that is what we
                produce.
            </p>

            <p class="lead-meta">What does our <b>logo</b> represent?</p>
            <p>
                Each of the larger ellipses that form a circle in the logo are designed after ourococcus. The eye-like
                structure is dual purpose, it is both the ourococcus nucleus and shaped like an eye to represent an eye
                of course, and the evolution of perception. The eight ellipses are coalescing to form multicellular life.
                The number eight symbolizes balance, luck, and the ultimate form of achievement. Clearly it also means
                we like to explain things too!
