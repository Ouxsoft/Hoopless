            <p class="lead">
                We make software for tomorrow by breaking the assumptions of today.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Ouxsoft?</h2>
            <p>
                Ouxsoft stems from the words “oux” and “soft.” “Oux” is short for Ourococcus, which is a green genus of
                algae. Why algae? Because small things coalescing over time have a big impact. “Soft” is short for
                "software” as that is what we make.
            </p>

            <h2>Logo Meaning</h2>
            <img src="/assets/images/ouxsoft/logo/color-black-bg.png" class="rounded float-right ml-5" width="120" alt="Ouxsoft"/>
            <p>
                Each of the larger ellipses that form a circle in the logo are designed after ourococcus. The eye-like
                structure is dual purpose, it is both the ourococcus nucleus and shaped like an eye to represent an eye
                of course, and the evolution of perception. The eight ellipses are coalescing to form multicellular life.
                The number eight symbolizes balance, luck, and the ultimate form of achievement.
