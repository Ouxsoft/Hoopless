                    <p class="lead">
                        At Ouxsoft, we make software for clients primarily on a referral bases. Apart from paying the bills
                        we try to open source high quality packages.

                        We believe building on top of open source
                        software and in turn sharing back what we can.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Our packages range from MVP to well supported and proven packages.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead-meta">Why we chose <b>Ouxsoft</b></p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Ouxsoft stems from the words “oux” and “soft.” “Oux” is short for Ourococcus. What is ourococcus you might
                        ask? Well it's a green genus of algae. Why algae? Well, because we believe small things coalescing over
                        time have a big impact. More traditionally, the “soft” part is short for "software” as that is what we
                        produce.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead-meta">What does our <b>logo</b> represent?</p>
                    <p>
                        Each of the larger ellipses that form a circle in the logo are designed after ourococcus. The eye-like
                        structure is dual purpose, it is both the ourococcus nucleus and shaped like an eye to represent an eye
                        of course, and the evolution of perception. The eight ellipses are coalescing to form multicellular life.
                        The number eight symbolizes balance, luck, and the ultimate form of achievement. Clearly it also means
                        we like to explain things too!
