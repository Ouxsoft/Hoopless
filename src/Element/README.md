# Elements
Elements are modular parts designed to be swapped in and out. 
These elements are for demonstration purposes. 
You're not locked into using any of them. 
Build your own and share back reusable ones.

## Atomic Design
It is recommended to think of atomic design when developing custom elements. 
Consider what Atomic Design stage the output would fall into, either:
+ an atom (basic HTML elements), 
+ a molecule (simple elements functioning together), or
+ a organism (complex UI components).

Elements often reside within page templates, but are not mean to serve as standalone templates.

## WYSIWYG
Elements can be integrated with a WYSIWYG, such as TinyMCE, to empower curators.
